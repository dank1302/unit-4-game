crystals game:

     This project is a game titled the Crystals game in which I have programmed 4 crystals to hold a hidden numeric value that
     the user can click on in order to attain the random number given to them at the start of the game. Each crystal holds a value ranging
     from 1 to 12, while the random number is generated to be between 19 and 120. If the player is able to figure out which crystals
     to click in order to match the number they have been given they win the game. If the player goes over the number they have been given
     they lose. After each game the values the crystals hold reset to a new set of random numbers and the number they are looking to match
     is also changed to a new value at random.
